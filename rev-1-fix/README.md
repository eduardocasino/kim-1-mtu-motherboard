# Fix for KIM-1 Motherboard

## **WARNING**

**ALTHOUGH THIS FIX SEEMS TO BE WORKING SO FAR, IT STILL NEEDS MORE TESTING. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!**

## About

This simple PCB fixes the first revision of the KIM-1 motherboard. Just put it in place of U4 and follow the install instructions.

(See [Issue #2](https://github.com/eduardocasino/kim-1-mtu-motherboard/issues/2))

**NOTE: This is only necessary for the first revision of the motherboard. Rev. 2 is already corrected.**
